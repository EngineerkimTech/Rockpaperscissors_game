Paper beats rock; rock beats scissors; scissors beat paper.

The game should have (at least) four computer player strategies:

A player that always plays 'rock'
A player that chooses its moves randomly.
A player that remembers and imitates what the human player did in the previous round.
A player that cycles through the three moves
